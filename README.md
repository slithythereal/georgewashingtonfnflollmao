## Friday Night Funkin' - Vs George Washington (FULL WEEK)
This is a fnf mod where you fight George Washington. The first president of the United States (so patriotic).

## IMPORTANT NOTES
- This mod uses Codename Engine (CNE) [You can download the latest builds from the actions tab rn!!!](https://github.com/FNF-CNE-Devs/CodenameEngine/actions)
- This is ENTIRELY MOD FOLDER! Which means when you download CNE, you can just drag and drop this into the mods folder.
- HOW TO OPEN UP MODS, go to main menu and press tab, go to the mod you wanna play and it'll open (most likely, they can be finicky sometimes).
